# Homework Assignment 5 - Work Day Scheduler App

The purpose of this homework assignment was to create a simple calendar application that would allow a user to save events for each hour throughout a traditional business day. For this assignment, I set a traditional business day to run between 8am through 5pm.

As specified in this homework assignment's instructions, the calendar application must:

- Run in the browser with a responsive layout.
- Feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JQuery.
- Use the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library within the browser.

## Sample Screenshot of My Work Day Scheduler App

In this section, I included a screenshot of my day scheduler app below. The screenshot include test text entries to demonstrate the functionality of the text area elements.

- **PLEASE NOTE** - This image was taken at a specific time. Due to both dynamic nature of moment.js and whenever this application is opened for grading, the coloration of the textarea elements in the app may not match the sample image included below.
